## Pomodoro Timer Application

I plan to develop my own pomodoro timer application. A pomodoro
timer is a specific timer where the user works for around *25-minutes* 
before taking *5-minute* increment breaks. After a certain number
of work timers are completed, the user is then allowed to receive a 
*15-minute* break. I have personally been using this study method throughout
both last term and this term. So far, it has been an effective method of studying,
so I hope to develop my own pomodoro timer application. 

**My application will include customization features including:**

- Adding and removing customizable tasks in a queue connected to timer
- Allow users to add tasks to a queue with timer type and task name
- Change timer times for breaks and working periods
- Change the number of work periods required in order to get a longer break
- Change background colors and/or image
- Change clock font

**My application will also include basic clock functions as well as queue functions including:**

- Adding or removing tasks to a queue connected to the timer
- When certain number of timers is done, connected task is removed from Queue
- Pausing and resuming timers
- Skipping timers
- Switching from break to work timer and vice versa
- Settings area for the customizations as featured above
- Include motivation text after completing a work timer (for fun...)

This application is mainly focussed and targeted towards being used by
students (like myself), especially towards high school and
university students.
