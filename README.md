# Pomodoro Timer Application

## Overview
Welcome to my Pomodoro Timer Application, a tool for improving productivity by helping you manage your work and study sessions effectively. The Pomodoro technique involves working for 25-minute intervals with short breaks in between. After completing a set number of work intervals, users are rewarded with a longer break. This application was inspired by my personal success with the Pomodoro method.

## Future Improvements
While the application is functional, there are areas where I could make a lot more improvements, such as implementing more abstract classes and interfaces for improved code structure. Additionally, I could explore the Singleton pattern to manage objects more efficiently as well as ensure usage of a consistent object in certain parts of the application. The UI could also be modernized to not only fit different screen sizes, but also be more visually appealing.
